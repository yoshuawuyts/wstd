//! Async event loop support.

//! The way to use this is to call [`block_on()`]. Inside the future, [`Reactor::current`]
//! will give an instance of the [`Reactor`] running the event loop, which can be
//! to [`Reactor::wait_for`] instances of
//! [`wasi::Pollable`](https://docs.rs/wasi/latest/wasi/io/poll/struct.Pollable.html).
//! This will automatically wait for the futures to resolve, and call the
//! necessary wakers to work.
