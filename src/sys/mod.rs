//! Each supported target provides an implementation under `src/sys/`, selected
//! here by a single `cfg-if`. The crate-root modules (`crate::time`,
//! `crate::io`, ...) are target-agnostic facades, free of `#[cfg]`, written
//! against the `crate::sys::*` items the selected backend provides. There is no
//! shared `trait`: backends are duck-typed in the `std::sys` style, and the
//! `const _` assertions below check the shapes the facades depend on.
//!
//! Backend modules: `time`, `io`, `net`, `http`, `rand`, `runtime`. The reified
//! pollable types (`AsyncPollable`, `WaitFor`) are p2-only and intentionally
//! left out of the common contract; once a second backend lands they become a
//! localized escape hatch rather than facade `#[cfg]`s.
